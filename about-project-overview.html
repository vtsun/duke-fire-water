                <p>
                    In recent years, wildfires have increased and spread rapidly, and have become more difficult to
                    control, especially in the western US. The cumulative impacts of wildland fire on watersheds have
                    not been fully understood, especially given climate-induced increases in frequency and severity of
                    fire. The examination of water quality in areas affected by wildfires is still lacking, putting
                    millions of Americans at risk. It is of critical importance to investigate the potential impact of
                    climate changes on wildfire and seek management options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prescribed fires are widely used to confront the wildfire crises and maintain the health of US
                    forests. Previous studies have suggested wildland fires could elevate sediment and nutrient
                    concentration threatening water supplies. However, how prescribed fires will impact water quality
                    and quantity have not been fully understood especially in a changing climate. Examination of water
                    quality in the areas affected by prescribed fires is still lacking, putting millions of Americans at
                    risk. It is of critical importance to understand the state of knowledge, identify research gaps and
                    explore potential modeling approached of the benefits and potential impacts of prescribed fires on
                    water quality in the Eastern US.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our research projects assess cumulative effects of wildfire on watershed water quantity and quality
                    using advanced tools that include hydrological models and fire disturbance models. Using a
                    integrated modeling system, we will investigate the potential impacts of changing climate and
                    wildfire regimes on watershed functions that are critical to clean water supply in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specially, the project aims to:

                    1. improve existing forest hydrological models and Forests to Faucets (F2F) decision support tools
                    to target catchments for restoration activities to improve water quality, and

                    2. synthesize the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and explore potential modeling
                    approaches of the benefits and potential impacts of prescribed fires on water quality in the East.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The USDA Forest Service has developed a 10-year plan to deal with wildland fire and this project
                    will develop the necessary tools and science for implement the plan. At the same time, research
                    outcomes (tools and trained personals) are useful for training future scientists for protecting
                    drinking water supply in many impacted watersheds in eastern and western forests.

                    This project will be developed in two phases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first phase is from 4/1/2023‒ 9/30/2023 and the second phase starts from 10/1/2023– 12/31/2024.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Task 1 (phase 1, 4/1/2023‒12/31/2023): database and model revisions
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Scientists at USFS will work together with collaborators on developing an integrated database and a
                    simulation tool for assessing cumulative effects of wildfire on watersheds by coupling hydrologic
                    models with a fire disturbance model. The fire disturbance model can simulate burn severity patterns
                    and creates new soil and land cover types characterized by the burn severity. Modeled burn severity
                    will be compared to fire severity maps developed from remote sensing.

                <p>
                    Using WaSSI-Fire model or DHSVM-Fire, USFS and collaborators will investigate the potential impacts
                    of changing climate and wildfire regimes on watersheds, including effects on disturbance and stress
                    interactions, streamflow, and post-fire ecological processes in Region 9 and 10 of EPA and Region 8
                    of FS.

                <p>
                    In consultation with USFS, collaborators will prepare the datasets and maps resulting from the
                    simulations and analyses that will be made available to FS. USFS and Duke will prepare a manuscript
                    describing the context, datasets, modeling approach, key results, and conclusions of this research.

                <p>
                    Explore potential effects of fire management practices could reduce fire impacts to water quantity
                    and quality through scenarios development and analysis using the validated DHSVM-Fire and
                    WaSSI-Fire. The scenarios include different management practices during three distinct time periods,
                    e.g., no recovery, initial recovery and fully recovered after burned. The fire management options
                    include prescribed burning, forest thinning/timber harvesting, or mechanical treatment.
