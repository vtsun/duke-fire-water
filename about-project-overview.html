            Project Overview
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Purpose
        </h2>

        <p>
            This project will develop a tool for assessing cumulative effects of wildfire on watershed water quantity
            and quality by coupling land surface models (WaSSI, USLE, DHSVM) with a fire disturbance model. Using the
            integrated modeling system, we will investigate the potential impacts of changing climate and wildfire
            regimes on watershed functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In recent years, wildfires have increased and spread rapidly, and have become more difficult to control,
            especially in the western US. The cumulative impacts of wildland fire on watersheds have not been fully
            understood, especially given climate-induced increases in frequency and severity of fire. The examination of
            water quality in areas affected by wildfires is still lacking, putting millions of Americans at risk. It is
            of critical importance to investigate the potential impact of climate changes on wildfire, and then
            watershed by developing or using existing wildfire models.
        </p>

        <p>
            The USDA Forest Service has developed a 10-year plan to deal with wildland fire and this project will
            develop the necessary tools and science for implement the plan. At the same time, research outcomes (tools
            and trained personals) are useful for training future scientists for protecting drinking water supply in
            many impacted watersheds in eastern and western forests.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Forest Service and Duke University have mutual research interests on water quality and fire research and
            have been collaborating extensively on the development of databases and techniques on hydrological modeling
            and education/outreach to serve the long-term vision of the EFETAC. Because this work extends research and
            utilizes research techniques developed under previous collaborative efforts with Duke University, it is in
            the best interests of the parties to enter into this agreement. The Forest Service and Duke University have
            mutual interest and responsibilities regarding the educational activities.
        </p>

        <p>
            USFS will work on database (water quantity and quality data collected at USGS gaging stations) and model
            development, calibration, validation. Work together with Duke University on studying the impacts of climate
            changes and wildfire on watersheds. Duke University collaborators will lead the bi-weekly meeting to discuss
            the project process and conduct the QA check on the model simulation results. Working together, USFS and
            Duke will develop a coupled hydrologic model with a fire disturbance model. The award will develop at least
            one manuscript and conduct outreach about modeling approach, and key results.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Project Timeline
        </h2>

        <p>
            This project will be developed in two phases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first phase is from 4/1/2023 - 9/30/2023 and the second phase starts from 10/1/2023 - 12/31/2024.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Task 1 (phase 1, 4/1/2023 - 12/31/2023): database and model revisions.
        </h3>

        <p>
            Scientists at USFS will work together with collaborators on developing an integrated database and a
            simulation tool for assessing cumulative effects of wildfire on watersheds by coupling hydrologic models
            with a fire disturbance model. The fire disturbance model can simulate burn severity patterns and creates
            new soil and land cover types characterized by the burn severity. Modeled burn severity will be compared to
            fire severity maps developed from remote sensing.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Task 2 (phase 2, 1/1/2024 - 12/31/2024):
        </h3>

        <p>
            Using WaSSI-Fire model or DHSVM-Fire, USFS and collaborators will investigate the potential impacts of
            changing climate and wildfire regimes on watersheds, including effects on disturbance and stress
            interactions, streamflow, and post-fire ecological processes in Region 9 and 10 of EPA and Region 8 of FS.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Task 3 (phase 2, 1/1/2025 - 9/30/2025):
        </h3>

        <p>
            In consultation with USFS, collaborators will prepare the datasets and maps resulting from the simulations
            and analyses that will be made available to FS. USFS and Duke will prepare a manuscript describing the
            context, datasets, modeling approach, key results, and conclusions of this research.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Task 4 (phase 2, 10/1/2025 - 3/31/2026):
        </h3>

        <p>
            Explore potential effects of fire management practices could reduce fire impacts to water quantity and
            quality through scenarios development and analysis using the validated DHSVM-Fire and WaSSI-Fire. The
            scenarios include different management practices during three distinct time periods, e.g., no recovery,
            initial recovery and fully recovered after burned. The fire management options include prescribed burning,
            forest thinning/timber harvesting, or mechanical treatment.
