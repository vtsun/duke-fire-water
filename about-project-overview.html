                    In recent years, wildfires have increased and spread rapidly, and have become more difficult to
                    control, especially in the western US. The cumulative impacts of wildland fire on watersheds have
                    not been fully understood, especially given climate-induced increases in frequency and severity of
                    fire. The examination of water quality in areas affected by wildfires is still lacking, putting
                    millions of Americans at risk. It is of critical importance to investigate the potential impact of
                    climate changes on wildfire and seek management options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prescribed fires are widely used to confront the wildfire crises and maintain the health of US
                    forests. Previous studies have suggested wildland fires could elevate sediment and nutrient
                    concentration threatening water supplies. However, how prescribed fires will impact water quality
                    and quantity have not been fully understood especially in a changing climate. Examination of water
                    quality in the areas affected by prescribed fires is still lacking, putting millions of Americans at
                    risk. It is of critical importance to understand the state of knowledge, identify research gaps and
                    explore potential modeling approached of the benefits and potential impacts of prescribed fires on
                    water quality in the Eastern US.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our research projects assess cumulative effects of wildfire on watershed water quantity and quality
                    using advanced tools that include hydrological models and fire disturbance models. Using a
                    integrated modeling system, we will investigate the potential impacts of changing climate and
                    wildfire regimes on watershed functions that are critical to clean water supply in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, the project aims to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. improve existing forest hydrological models and Forests to Faucets (F2F) decision support tools
                    to target catchments for restoration activities to improve water quality, and:
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. synthesize the state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and explore potential modeling
                    approaches of the benefits and potential impacts of prescribed fires on water quality in the East.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The USDA Forest Service has developed a 10-year plan to deal with wildland fire and this project
                    will develop the necessary tools and science for implement the plan. At the same time, research
                    outcomes (tools and trained personals) are useful for training future scientists for protecting
                    drinking water supply in many impacted watersheds in eastern and western forests.

                    models with a fire disturbance model. The fire disturbance model can simulate burn severity patterns
                    and creates new soil and land cover types characterized by the burn severity. Modeled burn severity
                    will be compared to fire severity maps developed from remote sensing.

                    Literature Review
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Forest lands provide the best water quality among all land uses (Sun et al., 2004; Caldwell et al.,
                    2023). The eastern U.S. is heavily covered by forests, managed and unmanaged, providing a majority
                    of the surface water supply for domestic and industrial uses, agricultural irrigation and benefiting
                    millions of people and the local economies (Liu et al., 2022). However, exacerbated by climate
                    change, forest disturbances induced by drought, flood, hurricanes, insects, and diseases, and
                    wildland fires negatively affect the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles at multiple scales and
                    elevate pollutant loading to downstream watersheds (Sun and Lockaby, 2012; Sun et al., 2013). Forest
                    restoration is becoming more important to respond these environmental changes (Stanturf and
                    Mansourian, 2020). For example, use of prescribed fire, a management strategy intended to build
                    forest ecosystem resilience to wildfire and climate change, has been projected to increase (Liu et
                    al. 2014; Vose et al. 2021; Greenberg and Collins, 2021).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Irrespective of disturbances, several site-specific factors can affect surface water quality,
                    including management activities, land use history (legacy effects), land cover, soil, topography,
                    rainfall, flow patterns, and disturbance characteristics (Hallema et al., 2018; Caldwell et al.,
                    2023). Landscape scale restoration activities such as prescribed fires, reforestation, tree species
                    conversion, and wetland rehabilitation can improve water quantity and quality (Smith et al., 2021;
                    Paul et al., 2022). For example, prescribed fires that are widely used in longleaf pine restoration
                    and loblolly pine conversions are likely to reduce plant competition for soil moisture during
                    drought, and thus enhance ecosystem resilience and water availability to aquatic ecosystems
                    (Brantley et al., 2017). Many studies in the southern U.S. suggest prescribed fires that normally
                    have low severity generally do not cause concerns of water quality (Sun et al., 2004) and fire
                    generally has less effect on sediment loading in the Southern United States than in the Western
                    United States (Crumbley et al., 2007). Increased soil erosion following fires is frequently
                    associated with forest floor disturbances caused by mechanical site preparation during fire
                    controlling activities (Van Lear, 1985). Similarly, operationally disturbed sites and especially
                    skid trails have been found to be more susceptible to erosion following fires. Most fire research in
                    the Southern Appalachians has involved fires of low-to-moderate intensity (Swift and others 1993).
                    The most important water quality improvement goal in forest restorations is reducing suspended
                    sediment although other variables such as nutrients, organic carbon, and mercury are alse of concern
                    (Chou et al., 2021). Severe wildland fires could elevate sediment concentration in the Appalachians
                    (Caldwell et al., 2020) threatening water supplies (Pau et al., 2022; Bladon et al., 2014).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the effectiveness of forest restoration decisions is constrained by both natural and
                    socioeconomic factors (Stanturf and Mansourian, 2020; Jones et al., 2022). Quantifying benefits of
                    restoration activities is challenging, thus more integrated studies are needed. It is not practical
                    to conduct restoration activities everywhere for improving water quality and aquatic habitat due to
                    cost constraints. Federal and non-Federal land managers need advanced tools that can be used to
                    support ecosystem restoration decision making (e.g., Watershed Restoration Action Plan) so that
                    restoration resources can target the most critical water quality hotspots to insure continued
                    provisioning of water-related ecosystem services.

                    Section 40804(b)10 of the Forestry Provisions in the BIL: Landscape scale restoration to restore
                    water quality and fish passage provides direction and funding for ecosystem restoration but there is
                    a need to identify the most fruitful areas for restoration. Due to the complexity of hydrological
                    and biogeochemical responses to landscape restoration activities under different climatic and
                    socioeconomic conditions, advanced decision support tools are needed for restoration planning
                    purposes (Mashal et al., 2023; Jones et al. 2022). Recent literature review suggests existing
                    hydrological and water quality modeling tools are promising for quantifying effects of forest
                    restoration (Qi et al., 2022), but have challenges to apply to watersheds affects by forest fires
                    and restoration due to the lack of empirical data (Crumbley et al., 2007; Ebel et al., 2023).
